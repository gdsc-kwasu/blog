Hello Techy!

Today, we are disussing Backend development. This field of tech is one that not so many choose on their first entry into tech, yet it is a field that canâ€™t afford to not exist. This is why I reached out and inerview Ameedat to understand her journey and hear her opinion.

The interview went thus:

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Ameedat. Kindly introduce yourself!

Ameedat Mustapha: Hi, my name is Ameedat Mustapha, I'm a backend developer.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Why Backend?

Ameedat Mustapha: Well, I have tried frontend like most people starting out in tech would. I learnt some FE tools, but I wanted to try many things, at some point I felt like I could do mobile app development, become a full stack developer and maybe some touch of UIUX.

In the process of wandering around tech, I tried backend development, and it felt like my thing, so I settled for it.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wow, must be nice.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I hear a lot of â€˜shegeâ€™ comes with backend engineering, how true is that?

Ameedat Mustapha: Smiles, I think this also applies to all aspects of knowledge.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That means you agree there is â€˜shegeâ€™ in backend development?

Ameedat Mustapha: Sure there is ðŸ˜‚

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally!
So how do you deal with these â€˜shegeâ€™?

Ameedat Mustapha: At first, it was difficult getting used to the shege in BE. Assimilation wasn't easy, especially when there is no tutor and I couldn't afford to buy course online.

But what kept me in backend development is interest and willingness to try things that seems tough. I think I love solving challenges.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How long have you been into backend?

Ameedat Mustapha: Two years.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What responsibilities comes with being a backend developer?

Ameedat Mustapha: Data Security, performance, scalability and simplicity must be your top priority as backend developer.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How does it translate practically to what you do on the web?

Ameedat Mustapha: Backend deals with delivering data to the web application, these data needs to be well protected, must have to be delivered fast and have the tendency to withstand growth.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What programming language/tools do you use to carry out all of these?

Ameedat Mustapha: There are many programming language that can be used for backend development, java, JavaScript, ruby to list a few.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Do I have to know all or just a few?

Ameedat Mustapha: Getting conversant with one is good, then if you are interested in exploring other languages, it's better.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Which would you recommend?

Ameedat Mustapha: I honestly don't know which to recommend, I'm sure all these languages have their weakness and strengths.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Letâ€™s put it in context. In terms of performance which language will you recommend?

Ameedat Mustapha: I haven't tried other languages, I have only used one and haven't really read about other languages so, I can't tell which is better.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Which one do you use?

Ameedat Mustapha: JavaScript (nodejs)

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay, great!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: As backend development is really crucial, how do you think more people can be convinced to join the backend train seeing as a lot of people will rather do frontend?

Ameedat Mustapha: I will advise anybody interested in backend development, to start with front end and make sure to build a few projects before going into backend. Because, writing backend can get really confusing at some points.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great! So front end, then backend.

Ameedat Mustapha: Yes

Aliyyah Kalejaye: But that still increases the pool of people in front end. Shege Dey backend truly

Ameedat Mustapha: Smiles

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Anything else you want to share? Any final words?

Ameedat Mustapha: Practice, learn, unlearn , relearn. Always put yourself under check. There's always something to learn.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Straightforward!
Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your knowledge.
