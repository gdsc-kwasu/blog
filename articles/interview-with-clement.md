Hello Techy,

In this interview, I had a conversation with my super amazing boss, the Google Developer Groups (GDG) Ilorin Lead, 2022, on how #DevFestIlorin22 happened. DevFest - Developers Festival, is an event organized yearly by GDGs all over the world. The aim of this event is bring techies in a state together to discuss career growth, connect, and most importantly discuss how google technologies helps you grow in your career as a developer.

We had one of such event in Ilorin, November 2022, when Clement - who is a GDSC KWASU alumni, was lead. This is why I interviewed him on how he became lead, the things he did right/wrong while planning this event, the lessons he learned, and so on.

The interview went thus;
Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Clement!
Kindly introduce yourself.

Clement: Hello Aliyyah.
My name is Nnamdi Azubuike, I am a front-end developer at CellCore, a technical writer, and the community lead for GDG (Google Developer Groups) Ilorin.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!
Your role as the GDG Ilorin lead, how did that happen?

Clement: On Wednesday in the month of March this year &mdash; 2022, I received a text from an organizer at GDG Ilorin informing me that I‚Äôve been appointed the new lead for the community. Afterward, a mail was sent in that regard to make it official. I accepted the terms and conditions, and that was how the journey started.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh so it was an appointment? You didn‚Äôt have to apply and do interviews or something?

Clement: Yes it was an appointment. Guess they got to know about the things I did as a student leader while in school. Who knows üòÇ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh wow
So, if I want to become lead one day, how do I go about that?
I just wait and hope to be appointed?

Clement: Oh waow, never saw this coming üòÇ
As we speak I really don‚Äôt have an idea of how becoming a lead at any GDG chapter works but as far as I know, it‚Äôs always within the organizers.

The term organizers stand as the core team recognized by Google, folks who have accepted the terms and conditions from Google. Basically they speak within themselves, look at who has the the community at heart and have soft skill such as leadership, communication skills etc, then they go further into making that particular person a lead.

That‚Äôs the information I have regarding this üòÇ. I hope you find it useful.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okayyyy thank you!
How can I build a Community mindset?

Clement: Mehn, building a community mindset.

Firstly, building a community mindset means you actively seek like-minded, goal-driven people to build a network of mutually beneficial relationships.

Of course, as a newbie or professional in your field you‚Äôll want to grow your network, the community is the best place to do that. Once you see the need of a community and the impact it‚Äôs going to have in your career, you‚Äôll definitely start making decision towards being a member of a community.

You know a lot of resources are shared in a community and answers to questions around your field can be found. Remember I mentioned at my presentation yesterday that speaking to professionals who are presently in your chosen career is helpful, the community is actually a fast route to accessing those big names in the industry.

Additionally, there are some steps one can take that would help in building a community mindset;

1. Defining the goals and value of the community.
2. Continuous assess and address issues or challenges within the community and work together to find solutions to make improvements.
3. Providing opportunities for collaboration and teamwork, etc.
4. Promoting inclusiveness and valuing diversity.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!
You hosted various events during your tenure as lead, but #DevFestIlorin22 was the largest. How did that happen?

Clement: To begin, let me briefly describe what DevFest is all about. All GDG Chapters collaborate to create the Developer Festival each year. I felt overwhelmed, anxious, and ill because I took it personally during the planning phase.

Since I believed it was my duty to coordinate the event, I stopped communicating with the other organizers.

Contacting one of the organizers was beneficial since he provided advice on how to make the event successful. Since this would help us achieve the kind of event we're seeking for and would help us get what our members would be expecting to see, I made the decision to work with community members as volunteers.

To make a long story short, I collaborated with 28 people. As the event day approaches, planning became more rigorous and the volunteers were divided into units. 13 presenters and 845 attendees were recorded.
I'm overjoyed that it was a success.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Amazing work! Welldone!

What would you attribute the success of this event to? What‚Äôs that thing or those things you did right?

Clement: Waow. Where did you curate these questions from?

Aliyyah Kalejaye: My head üòÇü§≤

Clement: Mehn. Let‚Äôs do this.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Let‚Äôs go!

Clement: Well, the success of the event is attributed to my leadership, critical thinking, communication and team work skills. I‚Äôve been practicing this while in school but after the success of the event I can proudly say I am good with the above mentioned skills. Asides my technical skill as a developer/programmer, these soft skills are so paramount.

Well before mentioning the things I did right, I‚Äôll love to say I made a lot of bad decisions and bad things which made me realized the right things I should have done.
The right things I did are as follows:

1. Working with the member of the community as Volunteers
2. Proper road map for the event
3. Constant communication with the organizers
4. Having a budget and final record for the event.

For time purpose I won‚Äôt be able to dive deep into them.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You are doing well!
I‚Äôm glad you noted that there were a number of things you did right and wrong. Learning from experience is crucial.

Clement: Of course, one cannot make or do right without a wrong.  
I mean one must make mistake before attaining success you get.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Yes, I agree.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there anything else you would like to share? Any final words?

Clement: In conclusion, I'd say being in a community is a crucial decision anyone who would love to grow his or her network in the tech industry must make. Not just a community but one that has the best interest of its member at heart right?

There is actually no age gap in choosing a community, just make sure value is added to you or you share value in any community you find yourself in.
That's it from me.

Clement: Once again I'll love to appreciate you for your time.
An interview of an hour took 12 hours lol.

Clement: Thanks for staying put.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol, thank you so much for your time, and for sharing your experience.

Clement: You're welcome, Amazing Aliyyah.
