Hello Techy!

On this week‚Äôs episode of THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU, I interviewed one of the very few Data Analysts we have in the community - BELLO MUBASHIR. Notice I said ‚Äòvery few‚Äô? YES! They are very few despite how crucial the field of Data Analysis is.

Why is this so? How can this change? - and many more questions are what I asked Mubashir in this interview. The interview went thus;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Mubashir

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself

Bello Mubashir: My name is Mubashir Maruwa BELLO. A graduate of the department of Computer Science, KWASU. I'm a Data Analyst who fall in love with numbers (data).

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You‚Äôve got quite an interesting name.
Thank you!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What do you as a Data Analyst?

I mean what‚Äôs the job description of a data analyst? What does a data analyst do?

Bello Mubashir: Ok. As a Data Analyst I collect, manipulate, analyze, data storytelling and recommend solution to organization or an individual.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay!
How crucial is this field in the tech ecosystem?

Bello Mubashir: It's very important to the everyone, a saying goes like this, a human‚Äôs subconscious mind is the best analyst because you consciously have collected data to predict what you are going to do. So without an analyst a business is incomplete.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay, but how does this relate to tech?

Bello Mubashir: You go into tech to build right? As an analyst you advice everyone in tech what they need to know about what they are building.

Bello Mubashir: What is the assurance that what you are building is good or that it is what the community needs?

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So data analysis solves that problem, if I am correct?

Bello Mubashir: Yes.
Let me give you an instance; as a content writer how do you know what you need to post, how do you choose your next post?. For an individual like you, I know that you will check your surroundings, the internet on the topic you what to write about and come up with a plan on how to write the next content. But for organization they seek the help of an analyst to do a better job for them.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great great!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How long have you been an analyst for?

Bello Mubashir: A year and half now.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Nice.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Data analysis is a very important part of tech, infact any industry, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be as popular as the likes of front end development or even design, why do you think this is the case?

Bello Mubashir: Many reasons. One, people tend to go for development, or design more, and this affects the population od people who go into Data Analysis. Also, if you‚Äôve noticed companies are looking for senior or mid level data analyst not beginners. So, people tends to move to the fastest way to make money. This is what I noticed.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You are saying the demand for experts leads people to picking fields that allows them to grow faster?

Bello Mubashir: Hmmmm not really. Based on the community around me, I noticed they all go for the fastest way.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So data analysis is more tedious?

Bello Mubashir: We don't have tedious programming language or tools. What is challenging is the ability to transform a problem just by looking at it, but you must back up your answer with data.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Transform a problem to what?

Bello Mubashir: By providing solution to different problem.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Oh okay

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What can be done differently to encourage more people to take up data analysis as a career?

Bello Mubashir: Actually I would say awareness and other analyst should come out. You hardly hear or see anyone saying I'm a Data Analyst.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol true
Let the change start from you!

Bello Mubashir: We should also organize a Data Analyst festival. One was organized in Lagos, but other parts of the country should too.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: First of it‚Äôs kind?

Bello Mubashir: Yes

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wow that says a lot.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there anything else you will like to share? Any final words?

Bello Mubashir: Data Analysis is the future, we are going to rule the word, watch out!!!
It‚Äôs me - Mubashir Maruwa BELLO also called mubEl descendants of Kal-El üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
