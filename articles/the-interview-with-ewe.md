Hello Techy!

Building a product that solves a problem can be very challenging especially if you are doing it for the very first time. Also, as a creator, it can be very tasking to have to open different apps for creating, publishing and promoting your content. The good news is, there is an app you can do all of these in.

The best part? I interviewed an Engineer on the team, and you are about to have an understanding about the product and the journey of its developer. Amazing right?! You are welcome!!

The interview with ADIO MOJEED went like this;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi codeLeaf!
Kindly Introduce yourself.

codeLeaf: Hello Aliyyah 👋🏽

My name is Adio Mojeed, code-named codeLeaf 🥑, a Software Engineer with major in Frontend, and all related.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, what do you do as a software engineer?

codeLeaf: As a software engineer, my responsibility is to help businesses scale largely by developing applications that can help them leverage on digital tools to ease their work flow, based on their requirements and/or market need. My day-to-day activity is to research, develop and maintain codebases powering these businesses, as well as managing the teams that makes this possible.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wow. Thank you for the detailed explanation.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How long have you been doing this?

Codeleaf: 4 years now 😁

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Agba SE!! 😅

Codeleaf: 🤸🏽

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How has those four years been?

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You know, the ups and downs

Codeleaf: Hmmmm!!!

Life is full of lemons and broccolis they say, but when you take better usage of both, you get lemonades 🤌🏽. Starting from school has been the major challenge, due to the nature of Malete as a community. Those challenges, coupled with schooling made it a tasking journey, but with the proper determination, here we are today.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Now that you bring school up, I was going to ask you, how did you come about writing code at 200 level (if my calculations are correct) since you recently just graduated?

Codeleaf: It started when GDSC (formerly DSC) arrived on campus. I came in as someone totally new to tech, although I had previous knowledge about graphics design, as I was a digital graphics printer. My prior knowledge of how computers work, helped me as well. I joggled fields before settling for web development.

Ever since then, I have been practising effortlessly, getting familiar with the latest trends and all I can say is, it was worthwhile.

I had a number of internships I passed through, as well as a couple of gigs. I got my first full-time job in 400L, which required me to get more devoted. I had to miss a number of classes then, and missed even more in my finals. But I am now a graduate, free to manage my time as I so wish.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: This graduate flex 😅. I can’t wait!

Codeleaf: You'll get to enjoy it 😉

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I hope missing so many classes didn’t affect your grades?

Codeleaf: It did in my 300, but I was able to handle the situation moving forward.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol I believe!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How were you able to manage the situation?

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Also, what were the ups? You didn’t really mention any.

Codeleaf: Itemising my to-dos, and getting them done in order or priority.

Codeleaf: The ups were there as well, and they serve as motivation.

Becoming an HNG Finalist was like a dream come true, and I can say is I am the 2nd finalist that came out of KWASU, following Ionware. My selection as the DSC Lead shaped a lot about me. I had to broaden my horizon as the lead, learn more things, which are all useful today.

Money - money is the biggest motivation. The first few thousands I got made me hopeful that I could get more, if I put in more effort.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Amazing! Money is starting to become everyone's motivation.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How much did you make on your first gig and how many figures are you doing now, if I may ask?

Codeleaf: My first gig was around 40k, and now, Alhamdulillah 🤲🏽😌

Aliyyah Kalejaye: We thank God truly, but give us update 😂

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How many figures? 🌚

Codeleaf: Madam Aliyyah 😁

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Sir 😌

Codeleaf: 6F

Aliyyah Kalejaye: God when?! Thank you for sharing.

Codeleaf: You are welcome.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How many products have you built?

Codeleaf: About 8, and still counting - ranging from EduTech, HealthTech, FinTech to SaaS. Although, some are shut down already.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Welldone!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, Mainstack. How did Mainstack come to life?

Codeleaf: Hmmmm!

Codeleaf: Mainstack is one of the best products I ever built. It is intended to help bridge the content creation space, giving your one hub to handle all your contents as a creator, and as well, get applauded by your audience.

I wrote the first line of code of what we all know as Mainstack today, and I can say is, I am so proud about that. There are a lot in stock for the users, just head up to [Mainstack](https://mainstack.co) to get started and start creating your awesomeness.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Amazing stuff!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What you are saying is, I get to create, push out content, and still promote my content for recognition on the app?

Codeleaf: Yeah.

You have access to various blocks to "showcase your badass", after which a personalised url is generated for you to share with your audience.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay. How is that different from what happens on Medium, Substack and the likes?

Codeleaf: Substack and medium are for publishing articles, totally different from what Mainstack does. Similar products are Linktree and disha.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh alright.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: But what I want to understand is, What is Mainstack’s selling point? What makes it different from these similar products?

Codeleaf: More features.

Linktree for example allows you to create just links, must Mainstack allows you to add links, your podcasts and videos as a content creator, sell your digital products, host masterclasses, helps you get paid, among others.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That’s so many apps in one! Mind blowing!!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally, how did your nickname ‘CodeLeaf’ happen? 😅

Codeleaf: Yeeee!!! 😅😅😅😅😅😅

It was coined from my family name, _*”EWÉNLÁ”*_ but people prefer to shorten it and call me _”EWÉ”_.

So, when I started coding, it turned to _*Ewe code*_, which I translated to English, hence, codeLeaf was birthed 😄.

Note: it’s codeLeaf (small c, capital L). It’s called camelCasing 😁

Codeleaf: This answers a lot of people question, I’m tired of explaining why everytime 👏🏽.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Oh wow 😂. I’ve been so curious.
Thank you for explaining.

Codeleaf: But I’m happy people find it unique 💃🏽

Aliyyah Kalejaye: It definitely is!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Any final words?

Codeleaf: Don’t stop putting in your best to unleash your maximum potential. The goal is to achieve the goal 🏋🏽

With the proper steps, everything is gonna be alright.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: True!!

Codeleaf: Thanks for having me here tonight.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: It’s really my pleasure.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for making time and sharing your experience.

Codeleaf: It’s my honour
