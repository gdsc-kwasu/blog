Hello Techy!

It feels amazing to have back here again! You have a drive to conssitently acquire knowledge and I love for it! Make it here weekly, implement the things you learn, and you are well on your way to making it big in the tech industry.

Let’s get to it. This week on THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU, we are going to be discussing TECHNICAL WRITING, and its prerequisites. Today’s interview will answer questions around; Who is a technical writer, What is Technical writing, What does it take to become a good technical writer, and so on.

On this one I interviewed our MAYOWA OLUTUYO A.K.A DADDY YO! He is a Mobile Application Developer and a Technical Writer. He does amazing work and it was really an honor interviewing him.

The interview went thus;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Mayowa

Mayowa Olutuyo: Hi Aliyyah.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself.

Mayowa Olutuyo: My name is Olutuyo Mayowa. A final year Statistics undergraduate in Kwara State University.
A Mobile Application Developer and a technical Writer

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, technical writing. What makes you a technical writer?

Mayowa Olutuyo: Demystifying tech stuffs in simpler words I guess.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That’s really straightforward.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What technical field do you write about?

Mayowa Olutuyo: Primarily elements of flutter, which is the language I use for development and sometimes I just write about my opinions on other tech matters.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How long have you been writing flutter?

Mayowa Olutuyo: About a year now.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wait, how long have you been in tech?

Mayowa Olutuyo: About 4yrs now I guess.

Mayowa Olutuyo: At least that I've been in the loop of tech let's say 4yrs. Experimenting and finding my way.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Do you mind sharing your story?

Mayowa Olutuyo: Of course, funny enough I started out as a marketing person. I was interested in content marketing and all, and that led to my job as a content writer for a tech startup in Lagos in 2019.

Around that time I was creating blog posts around what the company was building at the time, they were an ERP solutions startup. By ERP I mean, they built softwares that automates business processes from accounting to inventory and all of that stuff.

Along that I grew interest in programming, experimented across some programming fields from web to mobile and here we are.
That's my story in a nutshell

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for sharing .
You somehow still found your way back to writing.

Mayowa Olutuyo: Yeah yeah

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How many publications do you have currently and where can I find them?

Mayowa Olutuyo: I have about 11 articles on hashnode about 4 on medium. For my previous company I written quite a few things for them as well.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Welldone!

Mayowa Olutuyo: Thank you ma.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there like a requirement to becoming a technical writer?

Mayowa Olutuyo: Not exactly.

Just avoid plagiarism. When I started writing creating contents, at that point it was hard but now I've kinda found my groove and style.

To be a good technical writer it means you have to be constantly learning that way even you as a writer don't run out of topics to write on.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Just constant learning, finding your style, and avoid plagiarism.

Mayowa Olutuyo: You can put it that way as well.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there a need for me to be a technical person to do technical writing?

Like, must I be writing code?

Mayowa Olutuyo: Well it depends, technical writing is relative these days.

if you would be writing core programming language concepts, then yes you need to be a programmer because you might need to reference some code snippets in your publications and all.

But some other technical writers write around technical concepts not necessarily programming concepts they might not need to be a programmer to do that.

But all in all having a programming experience would always give a edge.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hmmm cool

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally, is there like a pathway to becoming a technical writer or growing as a technical writer? If yes, kindly outline it.

Mayowa Olutuyo: Just keep writing.
the first content does not have to be perfect your content would get better with time.

Constantly learn and read other people's work as well that's how you grow.

I’m that guy that thinks no course would teach you technical writing to be honest, you grow with practice just like every other part of tech as well.

Avoid plagiarism as best as you can and you would be fine eventually.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great! Thank you so much for sharing.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Anything else? Any final words?

Mayowa Olutuyo: As you grow in your career, avoid the noise and focus on YOU!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hmmm loud!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experience.

Mayowa Olutuyo: You are welcome.

It’s a Wrap on today’s interview with Mayowa. I hope you learnt new things and it also serves as a reminder on the things you already know. Looking forward to reading beauiful articles about your journey.
