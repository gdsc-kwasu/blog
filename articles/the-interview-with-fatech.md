Hello Techy!

The tech ecosystem has heard more of â€˜Your grades or certificate does not matterâ€™, than it has heard â€˜Studying a course in computer science and working to get a good grade has really helped me in my career in techâ€™. Yet, we have people on both sides of the divide whoo have proven their theories to be true.

This makes me ask, â€˜Which benefits you more in the end?â€™ - Having a good grades that helps me in my tech field or Just
having a shot at a good career in tech. In the end, the choice is yours and your answer is relative to your situation. Today, I bring you a new episode on THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU.

In this interview, I had the honor of asking a scholar a few questions. He is FARUQ OBASANJO A.K.A FATECH. A graduate of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a Frontend Developer. He shared with me his experience, knowledge, challenges, and so on.

The interview went thus;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Fatech!

Kindly introduce yourself.

Fatech: I am Faruk Obasanjo Adekola, a graduand of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, KWASU.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you!

Fatech: You are welcome

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Firstly, congratulations on your induction as GMNSE and on your award as the best student Faculty of Engineering and Technology, and your department, Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Fatech: Thank you âœ¨

Aliyyah Kalejaye: My pleasure.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, what do you do in tech?

Fatech: I am a Frontend Developer, though I am just catching up with one of the JavaScript library (React). Outside code, I do Computer Networking and a bit of Computer Hardware Maintenance.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That seems like quite a number of things to do with academics. How did you maintain excellent grades?

Fatech: One thing I must say before answering this question is there is individual differences, we aren't all the same.

Having or maintaining an excellent grade is relative, for me it is a bit easier because I was able to prioritise my programmes (things I do) based on the understanding I have about myself.

What I mean by understanding myself is that, I know the time with which I can read and have maximum assimilation and the steps to take when I need a maximum assimilation.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, understanding yourself and what works for you is really everything?

Fatech: Yes, knowing what works for you is the key.

For example: I know when I need an understanding of a subject and not just a 'cram la pour' I have to start from foundation notwithstanding the part which is being taught in class.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for the insight!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Has your excellent academics helped you in your tech career in any way?

Fatech: Of course, this excellence to me is all round, I know what I put my eyes on. It has helped me to be independent.

By â€˜independentâ€™ here I mean, a lot of time in my class we are faced with difficult topics that need to be understood. People like me and few others have no choice but to put resources together to get them down. This process has given me the confidence that you don't know only when you don't want to know.

So I reuse this pattern in whatever I am doing and it has always proven to be the way. The word here is research.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: The confidence in research you got from your academics is what you also apply in your career in tech, and that guarantees an all-round excellence for you!

Wow!

Fatech: Exactly

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I want to know, what were the challenges you encountered on this 4.0 CGPA journey plus a combination of tech, and how did you solve them?

Fatech: Let me clarify that I didn't graduate with a 4.0 CGPA but I have 4.0 GPA in a host of semesters.

The first problem on my list is procrastination but I later found a way around this which is to take tutorials. By doing so, I was always challenged to research widely.

Secondly, I don't know if you know that I stayed on campus throughout my undergraduate years, a lot of my peers didn't know the reason for my strong attachment to school hostels.

As a person that has a lot of academic expectations to meet (people thinking I have to know everything and hence, send me any kind of questions that come their way), I need good electricity and internet access which to some reasonable degree I got on campus as a student.

One thing I need to add for anyone that might want to excel both ways is to be disciplined and have confidence in oneself. One problem I identified with we students is having this belief that one can't know something by doing it alone or by oneself.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wow, you scholarâ€™s really have your lives figured out. I envy you!

Fatech: We scholars rather, because you are also one

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Aameen, lol

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally, do you have any hobbies?

Fatech: My hobby is research, I always want to know
This is the only thing I am sure of ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol ðŸ˜‚

So no sport? Music? And all of that? Just research?
I see why you are a scholar.

Fatech: It is not the reason, I didn't get exposed to those things right from the beginning so there weren't my thing.

I listen to music but it isn't an addiction. I do well without it.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okayyy!
Do your thing.

Fatech: Book has just being my thing, I can't even explain either

Aliyyah Kalejaye: God when?!

Fatech: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Anything else you want to share? Any final words?

Fatech: My final take is that we shouldn't see education (academics) as being useless as a lot of students see it now. With discipline, personal development (it isn't everything you will be taught in class) and sacrifices, you would see it pay off. Even if you don't live with the certificate it is still a worthwhile experience to have as the usefulness will come in ways you won't expect.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Words of a scholar!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your knowledge and experience.

Fatech: You are always welcome ðŸ¤—

Fatech: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I still haven't accepted that I am a scholar up till this moment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Your humility should be rewarded too!

Fatech: It is always my pleasure ðŸ˜€

Itâ€™s a wrap with Scholar 4.0 guys! I hope reading this interview helped you answer the question i asked in the beginning paragraphs of this article better. His final words have been on mind repeatedly too, and I advice you take the time to ponder upon them.
